Justin Williams and Tinman Kinetics have some great ways to use AI to tell the stories that ultimately elevate voices that usually get ignored.  My work at DSST Public Schools in Denver, like so many educational organizations, is searching for the AI solutions, and how technology can be used to reach EVERY child . . . lifting them out of poverty and allowing their voices to be heard for social justice around the world.  

My work previous to One Voice 4 Change and DSST was developing a virtual connection to learning in a room called THE SYNK. https://stemk12.org/academics/the-synk/ 
I worked with the co-founder of Polycom to design an environment capable of experiential learning reaching everyone.  Scrolling down to the stories you will see that we worked with China, Ukraine, and multiple rural schools in Colorado.

Freddy Rumeci,Communications Manager / Resource Mobilization,FVS-Amie des Enfants,"FVS-AMIE DES ENFANTS, formerly known as FVS-AMADE BURUNDI, is a non-profit association founded in 1992 by volunteers to help AIDS patients and their children. Following the armed conflicts in Burundi and the Great Lakes Region, FVS has committed itself to respond to the needs of many orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC): in 2021, ISTEEBU (Burundi's official statistics service) estimates that 73.9% of Burundians are living in poverty; and 8.4% of minors are orphans, particularly children aged 10-14 and 15-17 (12.6% and 17.4% respectively).FVS has resolved to work for the protection of the rights of OVC, their access to basic social services and the economic self-promotion of vulnerable households for the well-being of children. To achieve this, it has innovated by initiating a community-based approach to OVC care based on the value of solidarity according to the Burundian wisdom ""Umwana si uw'umwe"" (""a child does not belong to one person but to the whole community""). The approach consists in creating Child Protection Committees (CPC) in every community and Village Savings and Loan Associations (VLSA) or Solidarity Groups (SG) that work for the economic self-promotion of households and the care of OVC in their communities.Thus, the members of VSLA/SG contribute every week in 3 funds: the ""actions fund” to grant credits for income generating activities, the “mutual aid fund” to support the members of the SG and the “OVC fund” to buy and distribute school kits to vulnerable children. Indeed, among the many needs of OVC, FVS considers education to be the best service provided to an OVC child because it allows him/her to become an autonomous adult and responsible for his/her life and thus transform his/her life in a sustainable way.We have also created several institutions in order to strengthen our action. In order to sustain the access of OVC to quality education, the secondary school “Amie des Enfants” was created. To support the economic growth of the members of the VSLA, a microfinance institution, ""Dukuze Microfinance"", was created. The mutual health insurance ""TUZOKIRA TWESE"", the center for the promotion of solidarity entrepreneurship ""CPES"" which promotes solar lamps and the center ""Agateka k'abana"" for children's rights were also created.FVS is also recognized by the major development partners in Burundi. The ""OVC fund"", an innovation of FVS recognized by UNICEF as an essential asset for the sustainable improvement of education, has become a requirement for all UNICEF partner solidarity groups. And the government has recognized our Child Protection Committee approach as effective and sustainable: the Ministry of Social Action has integrated it into the national child protection policy since 2012 (FVS had been implementing it since 2002).",Fundraising techniques especially on self sustainability i.e running income generating projects that fund non profit service,Our experience with promoting and protecting vulnerable children's rights and well-being and our experience with village savings and loans associations in empowering and uplifting poor and vulnerable communities.

Katya Moniz (she/her),"Director, Global Microbiome Conservancy Program",OpenBiome,"OpenBiome advances global microbiome research to reduce disparities in health and scientific capacity.

The long version: OpenBiome is a non-profit microbiome health organization. We got our start 10 years ago as a stool bank, and have since provided almost 70,000 fecal microbiome transplants for patients with a debilitating and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal infection (C. difficile) that didn't respond to antibiotics. 

We focus on addressing gaps in microbiome research that are not being met by prevailing academic/biotech/pharma models, and where we believe the microbiome can provide an affordable, scalable solution to an urgent health need -- for example, severe acute childhood malnutrition.

My program at OpenBiome, the Global Microbiome Conservancy, specifically focuses on increasing global representation in microbiome science -- a field that has tremendous potential to improve health around the world but is vastly skewed towards US and European populations -- and building microbiome research capacity in the Global South. We are also developing a model for returning benefits (financial or in-kind) to the communities who participate in our research studies, and hope to offer this framework as a guide for equitable scientific practices more broadly.","I'd love to grow my network and meet more likeminded people at the intersection of science and its social impacts.  I'm also seeking guidance on how to find funders who understand the value of inclusive, global science and research capacity -- and the importance and complexity of getting the ethics right. 

Finally, I'd love to gain perspectives from thought leaders in community empowerment, as well as stakeholders in Global South government, academia, industry, etc., on benefit-sharing, developing capacity and infrastructure, and building paths for rapid implementation of health interventions at scale.",Perspectives on science as a key tool for social and economic justice

Mpindi Abaas (he/him),CEO,Media Challenge Initiative,"We are building the next generation of journalists who are passionate about using journalism to create social change. Our young journalists believe that good journalism can make the world a better place. Our programs are anchored on principles of journalism for social justice, solutions journalism, challenging negative narratives, journalists as leaders and empowering young journalists to become multimedia storytellers. Through a solutions journalism angle, we empower young journalists to study their local systems and hold their leaders to account with a positive inquiry perspective. Social and economic justice is key. Journalism plays a key role in educating and informing the people about their realities, the struggles and showing what other people are doing about the daily social and economic struggles. This is why our work of building the next generation of journalists is very important.","I need strategic connections for future scaling of our work both in Uganda and around Africa. OC has a huge community of investors, donors and leaders working on the continent that will provide me with opportunities, ideas and resources to scale. We are currently developing our 2024 to 2027 strategic plan that covers new interventions that address global challenges using media like climate change, misinformation and media sustainabilty. I am coming to OC to meet likeminded leaders who are creatively working at the frontlines of addressing these same challenges in their communities. I am looking forward to developing meaningful relationships and connecting with the OC network in order to broaden my understanding of the issues and develop effective and impactful strategies. I am thrilled to be a part of OC's mission to build sustainable solutions to poverty and injustice","I have extensive expertise developing long-term and effective initiatives that combine intersectional solutions between media and the SDGs to combat poverty. I therefore come to OC to share my experience with any delegates who are striving to use media in their communities to generate long-term social change. I created a youth media fellowship to address the issue of youth unemployment in Uganda. It has been very successful. This is an example of a best practice that can be reproduced throughout Africa. I'd also like to meet delegates who are working to change historical negative myths in their communities, particularly in poor communities. Finally I am excited to interact with delegates about my experiences combatting disinformation and misinformation in their communities."

CIP focuses on addressing policy and systemic inequity for BIPOC and materially poor people focusing on social determinants of health, community based education and organizing, economic development, gentrification, and housing. CIP believes that ultimately the current system rooted in charity based economics serves as a primary driver of the racial wealth gap and believes in the inalienable right of all people to have the resources, ability and autonomy to create and sustain their own communities in all areas including physically, emotionally and spiritually. We believe that for charity to exist there has to remain deeply embedded systems of extraction, oppression, lack of ownership and dignity within communities and people. We infuse an analysis that looks at the true creation of wealth in the land upon which we live in the US which is from stolen land, stolen labor and stolen people and acknowledge that in the richest country in the world we have never lived out the ideals we have stated we were founded upon and imbibe as a country or as an American people. We work to create systems that are sustainable, wealth building collectively filled with respect of the earth and respect of humanity focusing on those whose humanity has been systematically denied and extracted to bring the creation of communities built with healing, abundance and liberation for all.","The ability for folks to be open, truthful and accountable and recognize the ways in which ""isms"" have harmed and continue to harm those at the margins.","To be present and bring my experience, gifts and humanity to contribute to the experience of this space and the benefit of others.

Tatu Gatere (she/her),Co-Founder & CEO,BUILDHER,"In Kenya today, construction is one of the fastest growing sectors yet women are being overlooked for these high growth, high value opportunities. Currently less than 3% of construction jobs are held by women deepening the already existing inequality, with over half the population of women in Kenya currently living below the poverty line of less that 3$ a day. 

In addition, there are 2M workers needed in the Kenyan construction sector alone and only a fraction of that workforce is available. So Buildher is positioning women in particular to fill this skills gap in construction, essentially creating a bridge between the huge demand for skilled labour and the even bigger supply of informal workers. Our unique differentiator is that we are building this bridge with a focus on women.

Buildher connects disadvantaged women to high-value employment opportunities in construction and furniture manufacturing. 

Our 2030 goal is to increase the % of skilled, certified women in Kenya's construction sector from 3% to 10% while ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work. This would bring Kenya ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa and on-par with the most gender equal construction sectors in the world.

We are Kenya’s first and only technical training facility for construction artisans that exclusively trains women and actively promotes gender inclusivity in the sector. Our model and training approach have been distinctly designed to address the primary barriers that have historically excluded women from securing jobs in construction.

In addition to training, we run advocacy programs to gain public and government recognition of women's participation and leadership in the sector so that even more women can secure jobs at all levels","I am hoping to connect with aligned partners who see value in Buildher's unique focus. 

We have trained 400 women to date and seek funding to support our top 3 priorities for the next 3 years: To deepen our impact and women’s representation in construction","It would be pleasure to share Buildher's experiences and learning empowering women to build pathways out of poverty and low socio-economic agency. I'd also be willing to share and exchange experiences around the personal cost of social justice and equity work on founders and CEO's, and I am open to creating valuable connections with attendees around areas of alignment."

YSMF mainly focus on advancing girls education and providing a vocational training to most vulnerable young mothers. We came to understand that adolescent girls from most vulnerable families to thrive, compete with their chin up, and achieve their end goal, they not only needs a free education of not paying tuition fee or other contributions but also a full package of education materials to make them focus and be able to attend all sessions while in class. Due to national crisis on climate change, adolescent girls have been the most victim group who suffer and fail to reach their dreams due to lack of accessing water and basic needs, parents use the hardship situations at home to manipulate their girls. The drought has caused many families lacking food and fail to gets jobs in farming. Many girls have been married off to reduce the costs of education materials in homes. In a process of long distance to fetch water, girls has been raped, some of them has been forced to be in sexual relationship by their family members so that they can get money, education materials or food from men in exchange for sex. Girls has been forced to stay at home because it seems as waste of time to attend school without writing so that they can stay at home with their siblings while their parents/ caregivers go looking for food. YSMF learned all these and came up with the innovation to mitigate the effects of climate change which lead to school dropout, teenage pregnancy and forced marriage by providing holistic education materials to most vulnerable adolescent girls who are supposed to be in school. YSMF supported 2600 adolescent girls with holistic education materials in 2021 and 1646 most vulnerable young mothers with business and entrepreneurship and vocational training. The girls are trained on Life Skills, Sexual and reproductive health, personal development and leadership throughout the year also we provided sanitary pads to enable attend school even when they are in their menses.","To move this work forward I need to have an opportunity to meet and connect with new people holding various unique skills, connections and experiences to help me shape, re-building my strategies and learn other ways of providing solutions to end poverty through Fighting against Gender equality, Psycho-social support, education and vocational opportunities for girls and young women.
